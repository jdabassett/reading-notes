# My definition of the Growth Mindset

___
___

## To me the growth mindset boils down to two principles. 

1. ***Proactively improve*** your craft by seek new information and methods. 
1. ***Persist*** through obsticales.

___

## When I get tired. When I start to doubt my ability to solve the problem in front of me and continue toward my goals.

### 1. First I repeat this phrase...

>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
>>Freidriech Neitche

This often expands my focus from the mere problem in front of me to encapsulate my *"whys"* providing context for my struggles. 

### 1. Second...

Next I will look into my box of mantras that fit the current struggles.

Example:
```
When I am doubting my capacity to build any of these amazing and complex applications I come across on the web. I find comfort repeating this mantra. "Currently I am shitty developer, I am working to become a competent one."  This often works in times of self doubt.

Mantras must be honest to be effective. Do some soul searching first.
```

### 1. Third...

I like to search through history for figures that overcame a similar challenge. See others succeed can not only help clarify your goals but provide a model for a healthy way to approach your similar struggles. 

Because lets be honest you don't just want to get where they got but also want to get their with your family, friends, and health. :wink:
