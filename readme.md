# My definition of the Growth Mindset

___
___

## To me the growth mindset boils down to two principles. 

1. ***Proactively improve*** your craft by seek new information and methods. 
1. ***Persist*** through obsticales.


## When I get tired and start to doubt my ability to solve the problem in front of me I remind myself.

>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
>>Freidriech Neitche

This often expands my focus from the mere problem in front of me to encapsulate my *"whys"* providing context for my struggles.
