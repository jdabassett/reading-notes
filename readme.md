# My definition of the Growth Mindset

___

## To me the growth mindset boils down to two principles. 

1. ***Proactively improve*** your craft by seek new information and methods. 
1. ***Persist*** through obsticales.

## When I get tired and start to doubt my ability to solve the problem in front of me I remind myself.

1. First...

>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
>>Freidriech Neitche

This often expands my focus from the mere problem in front of me to encapsulate my *"whys"* providing context for my struggles. 

1. Second...

Next I will look into my box of mantras that fit the current struggles.

Example:
```
When I am doubting my capacity to build any of these amazing and complex applications I come across on the web. I find comfort repeating this mantra. "Currently I am shitty developer, I am working to become a competent one."  This often works in times of self doubt.

Mantras must be honest to be effective. Do some soul searching first.
