## To me the growth mindset boils down to two principles. 
1. ***Proactively improve*** your craft by seek new information and methods. 
1. ***Persist*** through obsticales. 
___

## When I get tired. When I start to doubt my ability to solve the problem in front of me and continue toward my goals.

### First I repeat this phrase...

>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
>>[Freidriech Neitche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)

This often expands my focus from the mere problem in front of me to encapsulate my *"whys"* providing context for my struggles. 

### Second...

Next I will look into my box of [mantras](https://lumitory.com/blogs/lumitory-blog/3-steps-to-create-your-own-personal-mantra) that fit the current struggles.

Example:
```
When I am doubting my capacity to build any of these amazing and complex applications I come across on the web. I find comfort repeating this mantra. "Currently I am shitty developer, I am working to become a competent one."  This often works in times of self doubt.

Mantras must be honest to be effective. Do some soul searching first.
```

### Third...

I like to search through history for figures that overcame a similar challenge. Seeing others succeed can not only help clarify your goals but provide a model for a healthy way to approach your similar struggles. 

Because lets be honest you don't just want to succeed but you also want to get their with your family, friends, and health. :wink:
