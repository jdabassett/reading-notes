## [**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

* Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

```
Syntax Errors are spelling errors in the code. 
Logic Errors are when the program runs without syntax errors but doesn't produces inaccurate results.
```

* List a few types of errors that you have encountered in the past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

```markdown
**Problem:** Working to solution.

**Object attributes contain null:** Found the solution but console.log()ing the object and working through the code until it contained the appropriate values.

**Code won't run:** Included prompts that wouldn't run, found solution through including proper link between HTML and JavaScript files.

**Code working but producing extra behavior:** Console.log()ed objects until recognised current calculations were appending to past results. Had to remove odd results before adding new results.
```

* How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

```
Some of my developer friends talk about programming as merely problem-solving. Constantly and continually solving problem after problem. Sounds like debugging strageties will come in handy in my programming career.

## [**The JavaScript Debugger:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

* How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

```
The JavaScript Debugger tool allows developers to track the value of variable and set breakpoints. You can open a webpages developer tools and navigate to Sources>File to add Breakpoints. With execution these lines execution will halt and values extracted to be displayed.
```

* Define what a breakpoint is.

```
Once a breakpoint is set, execution will halt at these lines and values extracted/displayed.
```

* What is the call stack?

```
Is a section inside the developer tools of a webpage that shows what lines of code were executed.
```
