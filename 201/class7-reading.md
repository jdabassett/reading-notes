## [**Domain Modeling:**](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

* Explain why we need domain modeling?

```
To construct a model of our problem that encapsulates our data, can be inherited, and modified to suit changes in our problem.
```

## [**HTML Table Basics:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

* Why should tables not be used for page layout?

## [**Introducing Constructors:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

* What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

```
An empty object that can be populated with data when invoked. It is simpler to invoke that a object literal and allows for additions of endless function/method additions after invocation through the use of the prototype function.
```

* How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versis when used in a constructor?

```
For object literals the this keyword only refers to a function contained within the object. Where with a constructor the this keyword refers to the object itself.
```

## [**Object Prototypes Using A Constructor:**](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

* Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

```
If something worked from the past grant application you can review the underlie blueprint and 'inherit' some of the structure and 'prototype'/methods into a new grant application.
