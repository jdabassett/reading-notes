*Why are forms so important in web development?

```
Forms are a means of gathering client data to create functionality for the user either by making their current website experience personal/dynamic and/or experiences in the future.
```

```
Size, complexity, ease-of-use, and resposivity.
We want to make gathering data as painless and benefitial as possible.
```

## [Introduction To Events.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

*How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

```
These are all events to a website. Seleting something, clicks, hovering the cursor, pressing a key, resizing or closing browser window, web site finising loading, input submitted, orvideo played/paused/ends.
```

*When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

```
The type of event and a function with an action.
```

*Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

```
Event objects are greated when an event is triggered and passed to the event handler function and can be used to access and change information contained in the event object. The event.target is a reference to the object targeted by the event and allows for each manipulations inside the event handler.
```

*What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

```
Event bubbling is the natural progression of an event up to it's parent elements. Event capturing is similar but inversed; where the code is structured to fire on the parent elements before any nested elements.
