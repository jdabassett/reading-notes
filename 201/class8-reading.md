## [**Learn CSS Flexbox:**](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

* Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

```
It can work with child elements with many different sizes to orient them along one line while allowing the option to overflow into a new line when needed.
```

* Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

```
The main axis is the vertical(column) or horizontal axis(row) set with flex-direction property. Once the main axis is set the cross axis is always perpendicular.
```

```
Using the flex-direction property to orient child elements visually to be in reverse of how they are arranged in the HTML will cause accessibility problems for screen-readers.
