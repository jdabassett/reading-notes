## [**Learn HTML:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)

## [**Creating Hyperlink:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

* To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

```html
<!--an a element-->
<a href = "address"></a>
```

* The href attribute contains what information?

```
The address for the link. 
For internal this is an elements #id. 
For a page in the directory it is a file path.
For a page across the web it is a url.
```

* What are some ways we can ensure link on our pages are accessible to all readers?

```
Keep the link text short and descriptive, while not repeating works like 'link'. Links are prefixed when read out by a screen reader and a link has coloring that differentiates it to those who can see it.
```

## [**CSS Layout:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

## [**CSS Layout: Normal FLow**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)

## [**CSS Layout: Positioning**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

* What is meant by 'normal flow'?

```
Normal flow is characterized by elements lining up on the left side of a page either one after the other if they are block elements or inline if they are inline elements. It is the default layout for displays of HTML when there is no CSS to style it.
```

* What are a few differences between block-level and inline-elements?

```
Block-level elments do not allow other elements to reside beside them in their line in the document flow.
Inline elements can queue with other inline elements in the line they reside overflowing only when they reach the viewport limit.
```

* 'blank' positioning is the default for every html element.

```
static: Elements render in the order they are declared in the document flow.
```

* Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

```
It doesn't disrupt the arrangement of neighboring element.
It can be utilized to create pop-up boxes, control menus, and rollover panels.
```

* What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

```
Absolute fixes an element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
Fixed fixes an element relative to the visible viewport portion.
```

## [**Functions-Reusable Blocks of Code:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

* Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

```
A functions declaration is like a blueprint.
Where a function invocation is the utilization of that blueprint to accomplish something.
```

* What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

```
Parameters are placeholders written into a functions declarations and will be 'filled' with an argument when the function is invocated.
```
