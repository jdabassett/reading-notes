## [**Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites:**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/)

* Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

```
To store data the user relies on for their website, yet doesn't wish to login to access from a server.
```

* What information should not be stored in local storage?

```
Non-sensitive information that is meant to persist after the page is closest or when an adjacent page requires it to function.
```

* Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it into that type before storying?

```
All local information is stored as a string. JSON.stringify() can be used to prepare objects to be properly stored as a string and JSON.parse() to parse those stored strings into objects again.
```
