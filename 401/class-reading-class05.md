## Why are these reading important?

```
```

## [**Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficancy**](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/big_oh.html)

* Prompt: Make a table with each Big O notation and it's name?

| Notation   | Name of Complexity              |
|:--------- |:----------------------  |
| O(1)      | Constant    |
| O(n)      | Linear      |
| O(nlogn)  | Linearithmic |
| O(n^2)    | Quadratic  |
| O(n^3)    | Cubic     |
| O(n^n)    | Exponential |
| O(n!)     | Factorial |

## [**Linked Lists:**](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

* Prompt: What is a good loop to traverse a linked list with.
  Solution: A while loop

## [**What's a Linked List, Anyway pt 1:**](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-1-d8b7e6508b9d)

* Prompt: What is a metaphor for a double-link list?
  Solution: A spy cell. Spy<->Handler<->Agent1<->Agent2<->Government Agency

---

## [**What's a Linked List, Anyway pt 2:**](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-2-131d96f71996)

* Prompt:  When are linked-lists preferable to lists? What about the inverse?
  Solution: If your script is predominantly adding/removing items then a link-list is preferable. If your script is doing a lot of searching than a list is prefereable.

## **What I want to learn more about:**

1. I need more practice identifying Linearithmic and Factorial Complexities.
