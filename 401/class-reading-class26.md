## READING QUESTIONS:

	1. Prompt: What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

		Solution: Url Mapper, View, Model, and Template are the basic components of a Django framework. For instance a request for a web page would first reach the Url Mapper that would direct the request to a View component. View would then extract the relevant data from a model and parse it into a Template before return this to the user.


	2. Prompt: Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

		Solution: 
      Model: An applications Model is responsible for 'modeling' a databases data structure and the interactions within it. Allow the user to store, retrieve, and manipulate their data.

      View: Are responsible for handling requests from a client. They parse through a request, process data from a model, can inject that data into a template and ultimately provide a response to the client.

      Template: Are used to dynamically generate the HTML that will be returned to a client.


	3. Prompt: What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?
		Solution: Tailwind CSS is framework to simply the implementation of CSS styling. It abstracts/generalizes a lot of CSS to enable developers to reproducibly implement styling features without needing to write custom code. It is a lighter framework than Bootstrap primary because it doesn't provide entire styled components; instead it provides 'utility classes' that can be added to existing components for styling.

## **What I want to learn more about:**

	1. I wonder how much to invest in Django. I want to learn it and am invested in learning the basics. But I wonder if after learning the basics I will prefer to master React since it might be a better career decision?
