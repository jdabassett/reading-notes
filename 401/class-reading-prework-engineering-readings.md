## [**The 5 Whys:**](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

* Prompt: What is the '5 Whys' approach and what is it used for?

* Solution: When a problem arises, the '5 Whys' approach can be used to drill down until a 'counter-measure' is found.

* Prompt: What is a 'counter-measure'?

* Solution: Rather than problems having solutions that might only be masking symptoms, it is better think preventatively. After identifying the source of a problem through the '5 Whys' consider counter-measures that will prevent a problem from occuring again.

## [**The Super Mario Effect:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

* Prompt: How does the shame/anger/regret from failure effect our learning?

* Solution: The trick to learning is properly framing failure as a growth opportunity with low stakes. With less of these negative emotions we will make more attempts, stick with a problem longer, and be more likely to succeed because of it.

## **Discussion Questions:**

* Prompt: What's the one thing I bring to this career and a potential employer that nobody else can?

* Response:

```
My background. I know what it is like to overcome a learning disability, to recover from a life threatening accident, to volunteer extensively for a religion and what it feels like to leave that religion, I have worked towards a degree and graduated with honors, I have fought for my first break in my chosen field, I have been the lowest intern in a company and worked my way up to a respected lab manager. Having a different background makes me a more empathetic team member and observant engineer for our clients. Everyone wants to be a positive influence in someones life and I have lived that from both perspectives.
```

* Prompt: What are 3 things I'll start doing to 'un-stick' myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Response:

1. Stop and take a breath.
1. Reread the problem until I understand it.
1. Break the problem down into smaller problems.
1. Make a plan of how to solve it.

## [**Things I want to know more about:**]()

1. I would like to learn more Toyota history, especially the early decades. I'm sure there are a lot of interesting stories that highlight the '5 Whys' approach.
