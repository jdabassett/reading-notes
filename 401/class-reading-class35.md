## Why are these reading important?

```
We are guarranteed to encounter these challenges in an interview. Preparation is the only think we can control as candidates so now is the time to prepare.

## READING QUESTIONS:


	1. Prompt: What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

		Solution:
		1.1. Restate the question to clarify your understanding of what the interviewer has asked you to do.
		1.2. Ask about edge cases and clarify ambigious areas.
		1.3. Ask for test cases that the solution should pass.
		1.4. Spend time explaining your approach and the algorithm, or pseudocode, that can solve the problem. You are opening yourself to hints, nudges, and at the very least demonstrating that you understand and can think of a proper solution even if your code isn't fully functional.
		1.5. When stuck, rather than shutting down, ask for some help or a hint. Try and be targeted in you request rather than a blanket 'help' sign.
		1.6. Communicate prior to the interview so that you can gather information, set expectations for yourself, and mentally prepare.
		1.7. Have compassion for yourself and your interviewer. We are all human and make mistakes. Don't shift blame to either for a poor experience. Some days things are just off and are not indicitive of a person or company.


	2. Prompt: From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

		Solution:
		1.1. Don't be afraid to pause and think. Don't talk. Don't second guess or worry. Sit and think about the problem before sharing your thoughts and guiding the interviewer through your solution.
		1.2. Visual or write down your approach and each step along the way.


	3. Prompt: What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

		Solution:
		1.1. The interview is a measure of your problem-solving skills, and aptitude. Not a measure of your memorization, and regurgitation abilities.
		1.2. From the interviewers perspective, "The more effective a candidate can be prepared for a type of question, the less informative that type of question is to measure a candidates aptitude." Avoid questions that require complex but formulaic solutions.
		1.3. From the interviewers perspective, "Do the questions we ask align with the skills we want in candidates?" If we only hire candidate with niche knowledge we are expecting them to train in that knowledge. If their core job never leverages that knowledge again you are hiring candidates that have trained in the wrong expertise.
		1.4. From the interviewers perspective, good problems have multiple smaller problem that must be solved and can be further optimized. Also avoid problems with specific mathematical solutions since those are really a quiz of the candidate's memory rather than ability to solve a novel problem.

## **What I want to learn more about:**

	1. I want to make a goal of problem solving without becoming stressed by failure. I can still succeed if I don't reach the solution and need to keep my brain fresh for a second challenge if I don't solve the first.
