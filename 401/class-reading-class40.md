## **Reading Questions:**

#### Prompt: Review at least one article from both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology.

#### Ethics in the workplace: Bill Sourour's The code I'm still ashamed of

This mirrors my thoughts on ethics. The view that unethical actions and practices are the purview of evil people is short sighted. In my experience on either side of an unethical experience it most often a lack of time, energy or opportunity that leads otherwise decent people and communities into corrupt bargains.

There as a great study on this topic. Darley and Batson, "From Jerusalem to Jericho: A study of situational and dispositional variables in helping behavior".  [Link](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-31215-001) The researchers would instruct some participants to prepare a sermon/presentation on "The Good Samaritan". Then they would either rush the participants or give them a leisurely amount of time to travel to the lecture hall. Along the way all participants would pass a bystander in clear need of assistance. The research didn't find factors like religiosity, age, gender, or wealth influenced who would stop to help so much as the amount of time the participants were given.

I believe this holds true with Bill being a junior developer eager to establish himself in his new career.

#### Ethics in Technology: Patrick Lin's Self Driving Car Ethics

I find these discussions around the trolly problem infuriating. In my exerience they are often activities focusing on the ant hill while overlooking the mountain around them. Personally I am not worried about mortaility decisions being made by a cars software. I have been convinced that the conservative driving built in by default will produce many fewer casualties each year than what we currently experience. [link](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/26/1195695051/driverless-cars-san-francisco-waymo-cruise#:~:text=%22The%20software%20can%20make%20the%20autonomous%20vehicle%20behave%20as%20conservatively%20as%20possible%20because%20a%20safety%20violation%20would%20be%20very%20serious%2C%22%20Wan%20says.%20%22But%20this%20may%20lead%20to%20concerns%20on%20the%20other%20side%2C%20like%20in%20some%20cases%2C%20even%20though%20it%27s%20safe%20it%20will%20fail%20to%20drive%20normally.%22) What I do see as the bigger 'mountain' is the rush to implement the technology before all the bug's can be worked out. And calling them bugs is to trivialize because what we really mean is how many people will die while the software is tested in the real world. More than software determining who while die the software must be two orders of magnitude better than human judgement to be considered 'bug free'.
