# **Reading Notes: Trees**

## Why are these reading important?

```
Trees are an amazing datastructure that are great for certain situations/tasks.
```

## [**Trees:**](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)

1. Prompt: Define these terms. Node, Root, K, Edge, Leaf, and Height.

  Solution: 
    * Node: Is a tree component that contains values and references other nodes.
    * Edge: Is a tree component between nodes.
    * Root: Is the node at the beginning of a tree.
    * K: Is the max number of children a node may have.
    * Leaf: Is a node without any children.
    * Height: Is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

1. Prompt: What are some of the different types of trees?
  Solution:
    * Binary Tree: A tree were each node has at most 2 children.
    * Binary Search Tree: A binary tree with node's containing lower values are to the left and nodes with higher values to the right.
    * Balanced Binary Tree: Binary tree that self balances with each operation.
    * K-Tree: A tree were each node has at most k children.
    * B-Tree: A self balancing k-tree.
    * Heap: A self ordering tree were a min or max node will always be at the root.
    * Trie: To efficiently retrieve key-value pairs.
    * Radix Tree: Used for dynamic sets or association arrays. Optimizes memory usage by sharing common prefixes.

## **What I want to learn more about:**

1. I need to practice recursive operations with tree structures.
