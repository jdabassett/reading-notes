# **Prework Reading Notes:**

## Why are these reading important?

```
These readings will help put us in right state of mind going into 401. With a focus on pain, Big0 Notation, and Basic Python syntax around names and values.
```

---

## [**Pain and Suffering:**](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

* Prompt: What is the difference between pain and suffering?

  Solution: Suffering is pain without a purpose

---

## [**Beginners Guide to Big O Notation:**](https://robbell.io/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)

* Prompt: What are the basic Big0 Notations and their names?

  Solution:

```
Constant Time: O(1)
Linear Time: O(N)
Logorithmic Time: O(log(N))
Quadratic Time: O(N^2)
Exponential Time: O(2^N)
```

## [**A friendly into to Big O Notation:**](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/8)

* Prompt: What problem does Big O Notation address?

  Solution: How will the time or data stored change as the amout of data inputed increases?

---

## [**Names and Values:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

* Prompt: When are values removed from memory?

  Solution: When no longer referenced by a name.

* Prompt: What happens when data is referenced by multiple names.

  Solution: Nothing. DATA IS NEVER COPIED!

## [**Python Module of the Week:**](https://pymotw.com/3/index.html)

* Description: This is good resource for learning about many individual Python modules. (re, enum, functools, math, os, hashlib, pydoc, ...)

## **Reading Questions:**

1. In the context of the reading "Pain and Suffereing," describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

```
The main challenges are the mental, physical, and emotional pain that comes from wading through our ignorance as we attempt to learn the topic. A helpful way to approach this pain is to properly frame it. Remember suffering is pain without a purpose. So long as we can properly frame our pain as a growth vehicle, then it should be managable. And hopefully transformative. 

Two framing strategies: First find mantras that frame your pain and use them often. Second, meditate and sit with your pain.
```

1. After reading "Beginners Guide to Big O", explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

```
Time Complexity is an approximation of the time an algorithm will take to perform an operation relative to the amount of input data. Space Complexity is the same but for the amount of memory that will be used by said algorithm.
```

1. Based on the "Names and Values in Python" reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

```
Mutable data types are changeable/mutable/maliable/reassignable where Immutable data types are fixed/immutable/unchangeable/perminant/unassignable after declaration.
```

## **What I want to learn more about:**

1. I need to practice labeling my code with Big O notation.
