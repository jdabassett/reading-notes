## Why are these reading important?

```
Data structures are the shit! In programming there is never one way to solve a problem. There are often multiple solutions, each with their own tradeoffs. The largest determinent for an approach, and its tradeoffs, is the datastructure(s) used.
```

## [**Basic Recursion:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

* Prompt: What is recursion? When is it useful?

* Solution: Recursion is a method of calling and recalling the same function within itself. This can be useful when the iteration/depth of a problem is unknown at the outset. Or when brute force calculations checking every element or performing every calculation would take toooooooooo long.

## [**Data Structures in 15 Minutes:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

* Prompt: What are 5 basic data structures?

* Solution: 

1. Linked Lists 
1. Array/List
1. Dictionary/Lookup Table/Hash Table/Object
1. Stack/ Queue
1. Graph/ Tree

## [**Big O Explained:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

* Prompt: What is Big 0? What problem is it solving?

* Solution: It is measuring the Time and Space Complexity with regard to the size of the inputs. OR, how does the time and memory use change as we add more data into our code?

## [**Basic Data Structures:**](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42)

* Prompt: What are some basic data structures?

* Solution:

1. Array/ List
1. Linked List
1. Stack
1. Queue
1. Hash Table
1. Trees
1. Heaps

## [**Why Big O:**](https://web.archive.org/web/20230207075759/https://triplebyte.com/blog/why-you-should-learn-big-o-and-stop-hacking-your-way-through-algorithms)

* Prompt: How should you think of Big O when coding up a solution?

* Solution: Consider it in the planning stage. Craft your code around the time and space constraints resonable to your application. They are an integral part of the soup.

## **Discussion Questions:**

* Prompt: What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

* Response: How will a given data structure with problem 'x' affect the Time and Space Complexity of a solution? Is it more important to optimize for Time or Space in a given application? Secondarily, will a given data structure help or hinder the handling of 'edge cases'? Maybe 5% of the time the datastructure be suboptimal in these edge cases.

* Prompt: How can we ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

* Response: Write the 'base case' or termination point first. Thinking carefully about how and when the recursion will terminated will prevent some of the call stack overflows.

## **What do I what to know more about:**

1. I really need to practice more with Trees and Graphs.
