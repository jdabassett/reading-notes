# **Reading Notes: Neural Network and TensorFlow**

## Why are these reading important?

```
Machine learning is the future and even if we don't anticipate building much of it, we will envariably utilize/incorporate it into our future projects one way or another. Machine learning and AI are the future.

## [**But what is a neural network? Chapter 1, Deep learning:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

1. Prompt: What are the different components that go into 'activation' at a node within a neural network?

  Solution: 
    1. Bias, an addition to the weighted sum. This creates a threshold that must be reached for activation to be achieved.
    2. Weight, is a value multipled against an input to the node from a distinct node. This allows a node to 'moderate' the inputs from a given input.
    3. Activation function, is the function that transforms the sum of the weighted sums and bias into a one number between 0 and 1.

## [**Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Tutorial:**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/convolutional-neural-network-cnn-tutorial)

1. Prompt: What is the basic workflow for image machine learning with Sequential?

  Solution: Load data, reshape/drop/process, split into training + test, initialize, add layers, compile, fit, and score results.

## [**Keras: The high-level API for TensorFlow:**](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)

1. Prompt: What is a model?

  Solution: "A model is an object that groups layers together and that can be trained on data?"-link above

1. Prompt: What is a layer?

  Solution: "The layer class...encapsulates a state and some computation."-link above

## **What I want to learn more about:**

1. Everything.
1. I would like to understand what problems are best suited for a neural network vs some other machine learning method? 
1. I am confused on how to judge the layers/nodes necessary for one problem vs another.
