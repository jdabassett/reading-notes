## **Reading Questions:**

1. Prompt: Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

  Solution: Linear regression is a basic data analysis technique to fit a linear prediction model onto two sets of variables to see if there is a linear relationship between them. There are standards to measure the quality of the fit (r^2, Coefficient of Determination) and standards to define the relationship as positively correlated or negatively correlated (correlation).

1. Prompt: Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

  Solution: 

1. Prompt: What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

  Solution: 

```python
