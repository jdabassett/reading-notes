## Why are these reading important?

```
Graphs are a basic computer science data structure that that can provide significant preformance gains when solving certain problems. Don't miss out on those gains bro.

## READING QUESTIONS:


	Prompt: Create a vocabulary/definition list.

		Solution:

			Vertices(Nodes): Data objects with zero or more adjacent vertices. 

			Edge: Connection between two nodes:

			Neighbor: An adjacent vertex/node.

			Degree: Number of edges connecting a vertex to neighbors.

			Directed Graph: A graph where each edge has a direction.

			Undirected Graph: A graph where each edge is undirected or bidirectional.

			Completed Graph: A graph where all nodes are connected to ALL other nodes.

			Connected Graph: A graph where all nodes have at least one connection and there is a 'path' between each pair of vertices.

			Disconnected Graph: A graph where nodes can have zero or more edges.

			Acyclic Graph: A directed graph without cycles.

			Cyclic Graph: A directed graph that starts and ends at the same vertex.

			Adjacency Matrix: A 2d array representation of a graph with each row and column representing a vertex and the value stored at the cell they share representing whether an edge connects them.

			Adjacency List: Is a nested list represention of a graph with each sublist representing the edges connecting that vertex to the wider graph.

			Weighted Graph: A graph with weights assigned to each edge.

			Breadth First Traversal: A graph traversal method that progresses from a node outward through all adjacent neighbors in turn. A metaphor for this would be a ripple in a pond.

			Depth First Traversal: A graph traversal method that progresses from a node outward through one adjacent neighbor at a time following that path of discovery out to the edge of the graph before progressing to the next adjacent neighbor. A metaphor would be electricity progressing through medium charting a path to the edge.

## **What I want to learn more about:**

	1. I want to practice representations of a graph and transitioning from one to another based on the use cases.
