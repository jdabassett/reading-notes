## Why is this important?
We will be using GitHub to organize the files we create while we are web developing. Being ambitous students, we will be making lots of mistakes. Like the late great David Rakoff said, "You really need to pay attention to each step, or you will end up in the soup."

GitHub will help us manage and restore files as we try to keep our projects 'out of the soup'.

## Flashcards

**What is version control?**
```
A system that keeps previous versions of file recorded and accessible for restoration. 

"When you done f&^%ed-up do you have anything to fall back on?"
```

**What is the difference between a CVC and DVC version control system?**
```
A Centralized Version Control System(CVS) is centralized at one location.
A Distributed Version Control System(DVCS) is decentralized into local nodes that comprise the whole.
DVCS is more resiliant to failure than CVC. GitHub is a DVCS.

"Although being so cork-fork special, you might be the exception to the rule."
```

**What are the three locations a file/file-version can reside?**
```
1)Local Working Directory
2)Staging Area
3)Repository

"Don't get lost on your way to Grandma's house now, this isn't that hard to remember."
```

**With these three locations in mind what is the terminal command to move files between them?**
```
1->2
>git add file.txt

```


**?**
```
