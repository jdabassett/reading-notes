# Git Guide Flash Cards

## Why is this important?
We will be using GitHub to organize the files we create while we are web developing. Being ambitous students, we will be making lots of mistakes. Like the late great David Rakoff said, "You really need to pay attention to each step, or you will end up in the soup."

GitHub will help us manage and restore files as we try to keep ourselves 'out of the soup'.
