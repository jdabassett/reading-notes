## [**The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained:**](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

* Why would we use a ternary operator?

```
For simple conditionals a ternary will often take up less space and be easier to read. This makes them idea to fit within larger code.
```

* Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement.

```javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

```javascript
(x===y)?console.log(true):console.log(false);
```
