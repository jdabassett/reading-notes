* *What is node.js?*


    Node.js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.citation: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

    Or, Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking,asnchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. citation: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info)


* *In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?*


    It is an open-source JavaScript engine to compile JavaScript directly into machine code. It was design strictly with performance in mind and runs on Chromium based web browsers.


* *What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?*

    A runtime environment is where a program will be executed. Normally for JavaScript this happens in a browser, the exception being with Node. JavaScript can be compiled and executed outside of the browser.


* What is npm?

    Is a package manager that comes installed with Node.

* What version of node are you running on your machine?

    v19.5.0

* What version of npm are you running on your machine?

    9.3.1

* What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jsint'?

    npm install -g jshint

* What is node used for?

    So that developers can run JavaScript code locally. This allows JavaScript to be used as a language to perform tasks on the server-side.

## [**6 Reasons for Pair Programming:**](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater Efficiency
1. Engaged Collaboration
1. Leaning From Collaborators
1. Social Skills
1. Job Interview Readiness
1. Work Environment Readiness


* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

    Currently, I appreciate seeing how others solve problems. Even if I might prefer my own solution, I still appreciate learning other approaches that could have added benefits.

* How does pair programming work?

    Two programs work simultaneously on a problem. One writes the code(Driver) while the second is consulting and proof-checking along the way.
