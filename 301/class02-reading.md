## [**React Lifecycle:**](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

* Based off diagram, what happens first, the 'render' or the 'componentDidMount'?

```
render
```

* What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

```
Constructor event is invoked.
```

* Put the following things in the order they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates.

```
constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount
```

* What does componentDidMount do?

```
It is triggered when a component has reached the end of it's lifecycle. This is a good pleace to close any requests and clean up after functions to avoid side-effect of code that might persist after a component is deleted.
```

## [**React State Vs Props:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

* What types of things can pass in the props?

```
numbers, strings, functions, objects, and arrays
```

* What is the big difference between props and state?

```
Props are values passed to a component like arguments are passed to a function. State values are held by a component that will trigger a rerender when changed. Think of props as the means to tailor children components and state as the means to store data, tailor a component, and trigger rerenders.
```

* When do we re-render our application?

```
Went state is changed.
```

* What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

```
numbers, strings, objects, and arrays
```
