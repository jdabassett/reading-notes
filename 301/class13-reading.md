## [**Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)

* What is the relationship between REST and CRUD?

  REST is an umbrella for the requests and responses that can be made between a client and an API. Where as CRUD is an acronym for the types of responses an API can made with a given request.

* If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be? 

  1. Make a server to listen for requests.
  1. Make a schema/model for your database to follow.
  1. Make routes for different requests and leverage the database model to create/update/delete as needed.
  1. Connect the routes to the server.
  1. Profits!
