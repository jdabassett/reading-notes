  Exposure to a field/expertise early and often during development shapes the wiring of our brains.

## [**Why diversity matters to your tech company**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

* When are diversity efforts most successful?

  When they are made often and consistently from the top of management on down. Especially from the point of hiring.

* Why do diverse companies perform better?

  There are two great benefits of working in a diverse environment. One, the available pool of information and perspectives is much wider. This may make decision making slower and more challenging; but on average mades for more accurate judgements. Second, Humans pay more attention when they are in an unfamiliar enviroment. When working in diverse settings we are more attune to others actions/methods and our own. This added awareness, when paired with the wider available pool of information, will spur more innovation.

* Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

  A diverse company will have a wider conduit of information to listen for treads and needs in the market. When companies feel a need/ability to innovate and shift their client focus; they can draw on this more holistic market information to make better product decisions.
