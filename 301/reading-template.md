## [**How I explained REST to my brother:**](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

* Who is Roy Feilding?

  He is one of the early creators of the protocols that servers use to connect and transfer data to one another.

* Why don't the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

  The protocols to transfer data for web pages is standardized were as the protocols for machines to connect and transfer data are not standardized.

* What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

  An HTTP protocol is designed to coordinate the communication and transfer of data between a client and server.

* What does a GET do?

  Requests data from specified resource

* What does a POST do?

  Requests that supplied data will be stored at specified location/servers.

* What does PUT do?

  Similar to POST but multiple PUT requests will have the same effect, were as POST requests could have side-effects.

* What does PATCH do?

  Request to partially modify resource.
