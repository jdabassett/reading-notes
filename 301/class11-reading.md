## [**nosql vs sql:**](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

* Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| :-- | :-- |
|More structured  | Less structured |
| Better for intense complex query   | Less so   |
| Primarily divided between open-source and proprietary  | Primarily defined by data structure   |
| Scale Vertically  | Scale Horizontally  |
| Most similar to a spreadsheet  | Most similar to JSON data   |

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

  Tables and spreadsheets

* Give a real world example.

  MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

  Hierarchical data that can fit within key-value pairs

* Give a real world example.

  MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

  NoSQL (IE: UnQL)

* Which type of database is best for scalability?

  It depends on your hardwares strengths. With excess CPU, RAM, and other hardware specifications; SQL can scale to utilize that excess capacity easily. Were as NoSQL can more easily expand with the addition of servers regardless of their specifications.

* What does SQL stand for?

  Structured Query Language

* What is a relational database?

  It is a type of database structure that organizes like data points together in tables.

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?

  All data within a table fits into a field(columns) and record(row). Data is connected between tables by id(s). In this way facets of a group/subgroup are stored in a table and while all data about the group/subgroup is distributed between tables.

* What is a ‘schema’?

  Is the order or blueprint of a database that dictates how date from one record(row) relates to bother data within the database.

* What is a NoSQL database?

  It is a non-structured query database.

* How does it work?

  NoSQL data is organized heirarchically first in databases then collections then documents which then follow similar rules about key-value pairs as objects in Javascript.

* What is inside of a MongoDB database?

  Database-Collections-Documents-Fields

* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?

  Probably MongoDB because there is no need for a document to be complete in MongoDB where as a record should be complete within SQL.

* What is the disadvatages of a NoSQL database?

  Data is often duplicated between collections.
